Using it for pullups, there is a little bit of movement which I was able to overcome by keeping body tension but for those who are more beginner then it may be a little off putting. That said, it didn't feel like it was going to give way at any point.&nbsp;<br /><br />I tried out a range of exercises which you can view in the video below including:<ul><li>Pull-ups and Chin-ups</li><li>Inverted Row</li><li>Various decline / incline pressups</li></ul> with a few more especially core training possibilities.<br /><br /><u><strong>Conclusion</strong></u><br />I'd have found this especially useful at the beginning of lockdown training clients out doors.

font-weight:400">How To Find The Best Personal Training Courses In Glasgow&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>When it comes to comparing personal trainer courses in Glasgow, there are a couple of things to think about.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span>Fortunately for you, we&rsquo;re about to break down what to look for in terms of accreditation and regulation, course quality, and how to choose the right study method!</span></span><br /><br /><strong><span><span style="color:rgb(67, 67, 67); font-weight:400"><em><font size="4">Course Accreditation &amp; Regulation Explained</font></em></span></span></strong><br /><br /><span><span>First things first, you will need to find a personal training certification that is regulated by an Ofqual approved awarding body, for example, Focus Awards, and accredited by REPs or CIMSPA.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span>Having a qualification that is regulated and accredited shows employers and clients that you are trained to a nationally agreed standard and therefore possess the right level of knowledge to carry out the role of a personal trainer.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span>Without an Ofqual regulated Level 3 personal trainer certification, you&rsquo;ll struggle to land a job in the industry as this is a requirement of the vast majority of employers.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span><span>If you thought that you could get around this by becoming a self-employed personal trainer in Glasgow, we&rsquo;re sorry to say that isn&rsquo;t an option! Without a regulated qualification, it's unlikely that an insurance provider will cover you.</span></span><br /><br /><span><span>Working as a PT without insurance is a huge risk that we would not recommend anybody to take, so unfortunately the cheap or even free personal training courses in Glasgow that are not regulated and accredited are not even worth the time spent completing them!</span></span><br /></div>  <div class="paragraph"><strong><span style="color:rgb(67, 67, 67)">Personal Training Courses Glasgow: Choosing Your Study Method</span></strong></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="https://www.strengthcoachglasgow.co.uk/uploads/1/2/3/3/123320581/image-3-study-method-graphic_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph"><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">Outside of ensuring that you study a personal training course that is regulated and accredited, choosing your study method is probably the most important factor to consider when comparing Glasgow personal trainer courses.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">Any reputable provider will offer 3 modes of study. Those are:</span><br /><br /><ul style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)"><li>Full-time courses</li><li>Part-time courses&nbsp;</li><li>Online personal training courses&nbsp;</li></ul><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">Out of all of these options, the &lsquo;best&rsquo; study method really depends on your individual preferences and circumstances.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">For example, if you want to know how to become a personal trainer in Scotland but don&rsquo;t fancy making the journey to Glasgow,&nbsp;<a href="https://origympersonaltrainercourses.co.uk/course/online-personal-trainer-courses"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-weight:400">online personal trainer courses</span></a>&nbsp;are always a great option.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">Online personal training courses with OriGym utilise an extensive range of top quality e-Learning resources that allow students to learn from a distance. Online students receive access to tons of remote learning resources and have email and telephone support with experienced fitness tutors.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">This allows for a completely flexible way of studying personal trainer courses in Scotland, or wherever you like for that matter, as your physical attendance will only be required for your final practical assessments.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re based in or around Glasgow and think that you will learn better through face-to-face teaching, opting for a full-time course might be a better option for you.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">Full-time courses are typically the fastest way to complete personal training courses in Glasgow as they involve 4 weeks of full-time teaching. For example, OriGym&rsquo;s full-time personal trainer courses in Glasgow involve a combination of practical learning in the gym and classroom-based lessons led by experienced fitness tutors.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">If you can&rsquo;t commit to a full-time course but don&rsquo;t want to solely study online, part-time or &lsquo;blended learning&rsquo; courses are the perfect combination of both.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">A part-time personal trainer course with a provider such as OriGym involves face-to-face learning during weekend workshops and online study utilising their award-nominated interactive learning platform.</span></div>  <div class="paragraph"><strong><span>Personal Trainer Courses Glasgow: Indicators of Quality</span></strong></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="https://www.strengthcoachglasgow.co.uk/uploads/1/2/3/3/123320581/image-4-indicators-of-quality_orig.png" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph"><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">Once you have decided on the right study method, the final step is to compare the quality of the various personal trainer certifications that you can study in Glasgow.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">All Ofqual regulated courses will follow a very similar sort of &lsquo;curriculum&rsquo; that is outlined by the awarding body, for example, Focus Awards. This means that the course content for regulated and accredited courses is fairly similar.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">So, how can you decide between regulated course providers? Here are 4 key indicators of course quality:</span><br /><br /><u style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">1. Standard of Teaching</u><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">When you&rsquo;re comparing personal training qualifications in Glasgow, it&rsquo;s important to consider the standard of teaching that a course provider offers.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">It's a good idea to ask about the level of qualifications that tutors hold and their experience in the industry. These factors can really affect your overall experience of the course, so don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask direct questions about the tutor&rsquo;s qualifications, industry experience, and turnaround time for marking coursework.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)"><u>2. Tutor Availability&nbsp;</u></span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">One thing that can really affect the quality of a course is tutor availability. If you&rsquo;ve already decided that a full-time course is the best option for you, then this isn&rsquo;t really an issue.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">However, if you&rsquo;re thinking of opting for an online course, then you&rsquo;ll need to consider whether the tutor availability matches your study schedule. For example, if you&rsquo;re planning to study around a full-time job, then you will need to choose a course provider with tutors available on evenings and weekends.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">OriGym is a great option for anybody looking for completely flexible study as they offer tutor support online and over the phone until 8pm on Mondays - Thursdays, until 7pm on Fridays, and tutors are available on weekends, too.</span><br /><br /><u style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">3. Standard of Online Services</u><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">If you&rsquo;re thinking of studying a part-time or online PT or fitness instructor course in Glasgow, then the standard of a course provider's online services is also something that is important to consider.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">The standard of the online platform can really affect your overall experience of a course, so it's worth researching the services offered by the various course providers.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">OriGym is one of the top providers of online personal training courses in the UK, offering a range of remote learning resources and top-quality e-learning facilities to make remote learning as accessible as possible.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">These resources include an award-nominated interactive learning platform, e-books, online lectures, electronic manuals, and interactive quizzes.

Many of us where hoping for news around personal training and the re-opening of gyms.&nbsp;<br /><br />**UPDATE 09/07/20 - We have a date&nbsp;</span><br /></div>  <div>  <!--BLOG_SUMMARY_END--></div>  <div class="paragraph">For the health and fitness industry there is in fact little change to what is permitted. In phase 1 outdoor personal training with distancing in place was allowed but only to one household per day. That has been increased in phase 2 to two households per day.<br />&nbsp;<br /><em><font size="4">That means classes outdoor classes or group training will have to wait.</font></em><br />&nbsp;<br /><em>You can read the full government guidance at: <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-phase-2-staying-safe-and-protecting-others/pages/exercise-and-activity/" target="_blank">Personal Training in Phase 2</a></em><br /><br />I&rsquo;ve personally witnessed some PT&rsquo;s advertise multiple PT slots outdoors per day and observed what looks like outdoor fitness sessions with many people. I&rsquo;ve also heard people make valid points around being allowed to visit supermarkets, travel etc. and so more personal training or fitness stuff should be permitted.<br /><br />My view is straightforward, the advice and guidance from the government is clear. We as fitness professionals have a duty to do what is in the interest of public health. We have experts who have provided guidance for us and we should follow their expertise. That&rsquo;s not to mention that insurance wouldn&rsquo;t cover anything out with what is permitted.<br /><br />There is some good news though. The Scottish Government last week advised the tourism and leisure industry to prepare for re-opening on the 15th of July. Now that is not a set-in stone date, but it is promising that there is something to work towards. This has also seemingly been verified by gym owners who had apparently heard from MSP&rsquo;s that this is the case.<br /><br />As we have seen in phase 2, there is a stepped approach week by week so it could be that as we enter phase 3 for example gyms could open on the 3rd week as part of the stepped plan. Of course, I&rsquo;m totally speculating but I&rsquo;m quite hopeful that by August there will be some activity indoors for gyms and the fitness industry.<br /><br /><strong>**** UPDATE 09/07/20<br /><br /></strong>Today the Scottish Government Announced opening dates for many different industries however the indoor gym and fitness spaces have only been told so much as that they shouldn't expect to be allowed to open before the 31st of July.&nbsp;<br /><br />Outdoor training is now permitted with up to 4 households reading between the lines although I haven't found any explicit guidance so far with respect to that.&nbsp;</div>  <h2 class="wsite-content-title"><font size="5">Get Started Now</font></h2>  <div class="paragraph">There are options to get started right now, whether it is outdoor training, <a href="https://www.strengthcoachglasgow.co.uk/online-training.html">online personal training</a> or when further restrictions are lifted, <a href="https://www.strengthcoachglasgow.co.uk/personal-training.html">personal training in Glasgow</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Or if you have any questions you can <a href="https://www.strengthcoachglasgow.co.uk/contact.html">get in touch now,</a><br /></div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Exercise Spotlight – Deadbug]]></title><link><![CDATA[https://www.strengthcoachglasgow.co.uk/blog/exercise-spotlight-deadbug]]></link><comments><![CDATA[https://www.strengthcoachglasgow.co.uk/blog/exercise-spotlight-deadbug#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate><category><![CDATA[exercises]]></category><category><![CDATA[Exercise Spotlight]]></category><category><![CDATA[gym]]></category><category><![CDATA[home workout]]></category><category><![CDATA[personal trainer glasgow]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.strengthcoachglasgow.co.uk/blog/exercise-spotlight-deadbug</guid><description><![CDATA[       The deadbug is a great core and ab exercise when executed with correct technique and control.
